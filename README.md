This is a project for MIT 805 (Big Data Processing) course at the University of Pretoria. The requirement for this course is to solve a real life big data problem using Big Data frameworks and techniques learnt during the course. Specific task include coding the MapReduce algorithm to extract and summarize your data and also visualising the dataset. The project requires selecting a dataset with size between 1GB and 10GB.
